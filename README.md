## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is my first ReactJS project. My main learning is how to communicate between React components. The challenging part was to reset all components when clicking on reset button, with respect of encapsulation of each component.

### Continued development
- Validation of user inputs is missing: validation is done internaly but there is no feedback to user.
- CSS is still challenging for me, I guess it can be improved and optimized.
